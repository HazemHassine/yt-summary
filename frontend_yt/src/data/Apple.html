<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>In a candid discussion, Bridget Cary shares her experience with Apple's new AI software and expresses her disappointment with its portrayed benefits. She criticizes the ads promoting this feature, showcasing users who are untruthful, unempathetic, and struggling to accomplish basic tasks. These characters appear to be using AI as a crutch to compensate for their shortcomings, leading Bridget to question Apple's faith in their customers.</p>
<p><strong>Critique of Apple's Ads</strong></p>
<p>Bridget discusses several Apple advertisements that feature individuals benefiting from Apple Intelligence, a trait she finds annoying and unrepresentative. These characters lack effort and dedication, yet somehow manage to get away with pretending to be knowledgeable or thoughtful thanks to Apple's AI. She notices a pattern of faking accomplishments and lying in multiple television commercials and invites her audience to compare these moments for themselves on YouTube and websites showing multiple iPhone advertisements.</p>
<p><strong>Negative Personal Experience with Apple Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>After enabling Apple Intelligence summaries on her Apple-based device for several weeks, Bridget notes that the feature did not significantly improve her life. Instead, it often provided robotically phrased summaries that failed to accurately grasp the original message. Upon expanding the message, she felt like she was needlessly filtering unnecessary information. As a result, she encourages others not to use this feature.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation of the Value of Apple Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>Bridget points out that various key Apple Intelligence functions have been publicly unavailable because public betas did not feature them at her writing of her material; functions of Apple Intelligence like: More personal Siri - wasn't allowed yet as stated in apple's commercial - and then she explained also that iPhone image playground functions can get edited when you start using that feature you have an option to generate emoji from any photo you have also iPhone right away explained to generate emojis also have image free function use freely - instead that - like emojis gen created from playground or emojis generated while your picking apple, has apple using very real smart AI since she couldn't help but wonder - what if Apple is thinking this generation just maybe needs a little aid due to how overworked/ understimulated or mentally slow from lack of life over other overwhelming habits not considered  and less because to AI itself  some of mentioned flaws she goes deeper suggesting those are not features worth noting, hence AI should be all about assisting people on things like freeing themselves from household chores like dishwashing which make a nice contribution to technology, helping create life where things aid more at lifes' harder situations. The ability to perform house chores and having time should always value such knowledge in developing 'AI.'  <strong>A Look Back at Apple's Core Values</strong></p>
<p>Bridget questions whether Apple Intelligence services uphold the brand's core values, notably the principle of 'Think Different' put forth by Steve Jobs. Instead of helping rebels push the boundaries of human achievement, Apple seems to cater to those struggling to accomplish basic tasks.</p>
