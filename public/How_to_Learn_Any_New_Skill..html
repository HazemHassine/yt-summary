    <div><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<h4>Overview of the Video</h4>

<p>The YouTube video discusses a step-by-step process for learning any new skill. The speaker emphasizes the importance of persistence and having the right mindset while acquiring a new skill.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Set a Specific Goal</strong>
The speaker stresses the significance of setting specific goals before learning a new skill. This goal should be broken down into smaller, achievable tasks. However, having a broad goal is just as important as setting milestones that lead to it. In order to understand this concept the example of aspiring novelists working for a specific timeframe were presented.
For instance, a person aiming to write a book shouldn&#39;t start with overly broad goals like &quot;I will be the greatest author&quot; - they should rather plan on writing &quot;X hours a day, for Y consecutive days&quot;. Planning the way is better than mere planning if they feel necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Create a Plan</strong>
Once the specific goal is set, the next step is to create a detailed plan of action. This includes understanding the requirements of the skill and the amount of time and dedication required to achieve it. For example, aspiring to be a competitive boxer needs that basic rules, conditioning and the road map how to prepare oneself. Without defining what you should do, you shouldnt&#39; search what to do.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Utilize Spaced Repetition</strong>
The speaker emphasizes the importance of using spaced repetition in the learning process. This technique involves practicing or studying a concept or skill at increasingly longer intervals to solidify it in long-term memory.
With the use of proper utilization and controlled of spaced repetition of material (e.g. any of methods available by common experience: repetition without repetition etc) can lead a good quality assimilation of the &#39;stuff&#39;. Quality beats the quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Practice Active Recall</strong>
Another technique mentioned in the video is active recall. This involves testing oneself on the new information or skills learned. This method, as explains by known mnemonic examples like abCd etc. on top of or following as the same, (ruling the strength) both (or all methods suitable) simultaneously is more beneficial than a practice &quot;passive reading&quot; which refers to only quick refreshment (while the other type stimulates it.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Get Feedback</strong>
The speaker also emphasizes the importance of getting feedback from others while learning a new skill. This includes finding a coach or a study group and allowing them to track one&#39;s progress. Adding to that feedback helps learner to have bird`eye with the most critical awareness there on, and the need for external positive and &#39;live&#39; touch.</p></div>
