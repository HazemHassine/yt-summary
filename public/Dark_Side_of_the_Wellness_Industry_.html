<h2>**The Multi-Billion-Dollar Industry**</h2>

<h2>**Marketing and Packaging**</h2>

These include creating buzzwords, promoting lifestyles, and labeling products as &quot;clean&quot;, &quot;sustainable,&quot; or &quot;vegan&quot;. It&#39;s pointed out that many of these products aren&#39;t regulated, often making unsubstantiated claims about their effectiveness.</p>

<h3><strong>Emotional Manipulation and Consumerism</strong></h3>

Marketing materials often capitalize on people&#39;s passions, hopes, fears, and anxieties, the emphasis on authenticity or shared community experience makes individuals more susceptible to suggestions made.</p>

<h2>**Pseudoscience and Lack of Evidence**</h2>

<p>Many wellness products and services tout remarkable benefits with little or no empirical evidence backing up these claims.

Key players cited utilize simplistic science knowledge selling doubt thereby undermining well grounded theories backed with irrefutable evidence</p>

<h2>**Case Study 1 - Essential Oils**</h2>

<h3><strong>Case Study 2 - The Alkaline Diet</strong></h3>
