    <h1>Building a 24 Hour Server for Under 20 Dollars </h1>
    <span>2024-12-01T23:55:26.880Z</span>
    <div><p><strong>Introduction</strong>
The YouTube video focuses on building a low-cost server, specifically designed for long-term operations like continuous computing, storage, mining, and more. The server will be intended for lightweight user applications such as nextcloud, hosting personal websites, NAS, bittorrent clients, game servers, home automation, IP camera, and similar small scale IOT projects.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Requirements</strong></p>

<ul><li>For under $20, one must get creative in choosing components. </li><li>A major focus will be on reusing or up-cycling an old gadget and finding dirt-cheap solutions through sales.</li></ul>

<p>The maker decides to repurpose an <strong>ATMEL ATSAMG5-AEB00 board</strong>, a high-performance, low-power 32-bit SoC core processor which boasts 16KB of datasheet &quot;SRAM on-board RAM&quot;.
However, given the maker wanted more ram, he quickly moved towards buying a brand new &quot;olimex atmel ATSAMD51 G25 SOM8M and more onboard stuff &quot;which arrived last night 
During this particular section an emphasis is on re purposing vs just buying outright - reuse, vs consumption and how this reuse actually costs greater while also generally cost both greater (Time And effort, Than Just outright purchase would. &quot;Just don&#39;t forget this&quot;. (at the time, as its getting late in an attempt to wind the film down)- basically pointing &quot;that there should likely probably be such &quot;a fine for this&quot;
He&#39;s seen and found that on AliExpress as small Pico-ITX or any others smaller PC motherboards </p>

<p><strong>Development of the Idea and Planning</strong></p>

<p>Throughout this process of deciding building techniques they further explore the possibility of such things as using Arduino MKR boards running OS through a very early-stage, alpha/beta version available named &quot;for Wiscore&quot; based off of more solid, proven stuff.. OS that are fairly stripped such Micro NORTOS.
we will be developing and exploring of what else it would be capable for to make all processes much easier for regular projects the potential open source things run by enthusiasts under Osource are available </p>

<p>Moving beyond an effective $20 idea will further improve OS to be more complete</p>

<p>Several things maker says  is possible depending on exactly what everything was or is that an official armm based os is necessary a very critical and crucial alternative 
so the entire micro PC that now use about 7V current from whatever such better power.</p>

<p>The full PC running ARM was very much &quot;close, close, extremely&quot; viable fully under proper expectation in my original of roughly cheap specs roughly idea range.</p></div>
