    <h1>Renigon Method (or Concentric Circle Method) for Learning AI</h1>
    <span>2024-12-02T22:55:19.063Z</span>
    <div><p><strong>Introduction</strong>
The video describes the Renigon Method (or Concentric Circle Method), a learning approach that focuses on building excitement and motivation while learning Artificial Intelligence (AI). The method is designed for individuals with short attention spans who struggle to maintain their motivation throughout the learning process.</p>

<p><strong>The Renigon Method</strong>
The Renigon Method consists of a series of concentric circles, with each circle representing a level of learning. The goal is to start from the innermost circle and gradually move to the outer circles, building on the knowledge and excitement gained in the previous circle.</p>

<ol><li><strong>Inner Circle (Learning the Basics of AI)</strong>
The inner circle focuses on acquiring the basic knowledge of AI, including:<ul><li>Understanding how machine learning works</li><li>Learning the basics of programming (e.g., variables, data types, if-else statements, loops)</li><li>Familiarizing yourself with Python APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for interacting with other people&#39;s software</li></ul></li></ol>

<p>Recommended resources for this circle include:
	<em> Brilliant (interactive course on Python and AI)
	</em> Free Code Camp (video introduction to Python)
	* &quot;Automate the Boring Stuff&quot; (textbook for beginner-friendly introduction to Python)</p>

<p><strong>Building Excitement and Motivation</strong>
After completing the inner circle, you build a simple AI product, such as a chatbot or personal assistant. This project is designed to generate excitement and motivation, encouraging you to continue learning.</p>

<p><strong>Expansion to the Next Circle (Learning More Advanced Concepts)</strong>
With the excitement and motivation gained from building a simple AI product, you move on to the next circle, which focuses on more advanced concepts, such as:
	<em> Understanding machine learning algorithms
	</em> Learning the basics of large language models
	* Developing prompt engineering skills</p>

<p>Recommended resources for this circle include:
	<em> Brilliant (crash course on large language models)
	</em> Deeplearning.ai (free course on prompt engineering for developers)</p>

<p><strong>Middle Circle (Building a Solid Foundation)</strong>
Before diving deeper into AI, you need to lay a solid foundation by learning more advanced Python concepts, such as:
	<em> NumPy
	</em> Pandas
	<em> Matplotlib
	</em> scikit-learn (for building machine learning models)</p>

<p>Recommended resources for this circle include:
	<em> Free Code Camp (courses on NumPy and Pandas)
	</em> Python for Data Analysis (textbook)</p>

<p><strong>Mathematics and Statistics</strong>
You also need to brush up on your math and statistics skills, focusing on:
	<em> Calculus
	</em> Linear Algebra
	* Probability and statistics</p>

<p>Recommended resources for this circle include:
	<em> Brilliant (courses on calculus and linear algebra)
	</em> coursera (Specializations on machine learning and deep learning)</p>

<p><strong>Expansion to the Next Circle (Diving Deeper into AI)</strong>
With a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics, you can dive deeper into AI, focusing on:
	<em> Machine learning algorithms (e.g., decision trees, regression)
	</em> Deep learning concepts (e.g., neural networks, deep neural networks)</p>

<p>Recommended resources for this circle include:
	<em> Josh Starmer (YouTube channel for machine learning explanations)
	</em> Brilliant (courses on deep learning and introduction to late language models)</p>

<p><strong>Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing</strong>
Finally, you can branch out into different subfields of AI, including:
	<em> Computer vision
	</em> Natural language processing</p>

<p>Recommended resources for these subfields include:
	<em> Brilliant (courses on neural networks and introduction to late language models)
	</em> coursera (Specializations on computer vision and natural language processing)</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
The Renigon Method offers a structured approach to learning AI, focusing on building excitement and motivation throughout the learning process. By following this method and using the recommended resources, you can develop a comprehensive understanding of AI and build your skills in the field.</p></div>
